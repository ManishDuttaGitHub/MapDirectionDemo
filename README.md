# MapDirectionDemo

There are lot of features that can be added with Google maps API. One of them includes the feature to calculate distance between two points. I have created a demo on it and written a tutorial: [This is How You Can Calculate Distance Between Two GPS Coordinates Using Google Maps API](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/calculate-distance-two-gps-coordinates-google-maps-api/).

If you face any issue implementing it, you can contact me for help. Also, if you want to implement this feature in your iOS app and looking to [hire Android app developer](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/hire-android-developer/Â ) to help you, then you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
